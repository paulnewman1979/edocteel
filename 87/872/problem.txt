Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

           3
         /   \
        5     1
       / \   / \
      6   2 9   8
         / \
        7   4 

           3
         /   \
        5     1
       / \   / \
      6   7 2   8
           / \
           4  9 


For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

 

Note:

Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 100 nodes.
